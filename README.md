In this dataset you can also submit your results of the requested tasks, these tasks are very cool and help a lot for the progress of research in relation to COVID-19.

In this project I made predictions **for the next 15 days of August 2020**, the data available are up to the **date of 12/08/2020**, that is, my predictions were made from that date and will continue until the next 15 days . The forecasts are valid until the end of the month, which is when the 15 days of the calculations made are completed.

After these 15 days I intend to update the projects, that way I will be able to follow the evolution of my results. Within this project I leave my contributions and comments on the results found! I hope you like it!
